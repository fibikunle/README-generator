  ## Installation
  After cloning or downloading a local copy of the repository, from a terminal install the required dependencies that are listed in the package.json file:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  Once the node_modules folder is created and all dependencies are downloaded, type the following in your terminal:
  
  ```
  npm start
  ```
  The *start* command effectively stands in for running "node index.js" as shown in the "scripts" property in the package.json file you download.
